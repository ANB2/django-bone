About
=====

Starting a new Django project?  django-bone will save you a few days worth of
work by generating all the annoying boilerplate code for you.  One simple
command is all that's needed to set up everything you'd expect from a
bona-fide python project: a setup file and Makefile, documentation, unit
tests, pyflakes/pep8 tests, version control, virtualenv, db migrations,
Twitter Bootstrap, js/css minimization, deployment scripts, init.d file, etc.

django-bone configures your code to follow what I believe to be the 'one true
path' to django enlightenment, using design practices we've been refining for
years.  Your project will also be configured with some of the greatest tools
available which we feel are stable, not too unfamiliar, and have stood the
test of time.

Please note that the ``manage.py`` hack is removed because it's always made me
sad that so few Django developers take the time to write ``setup.py`` files
like the rest of the python community :( Instead of ``manage.py`` you'll run a
command named after your project.


Usage
=====

Install the script and make some minor system changes::

    sudo ./install.sh
    sudo easy_install -U pip
    sudo pip install -U virtualenv
    sudo chmod go+rwt /opt  # let people create new files in /opt
    export PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE=~/.pip/cache

Create a new project::

    cd /opt
    django-bone myapp
    cd myapp/myapp
    source ../bin/activate
    make dev && myapp-dev runserver

The following tools and libraries will also be configured:

- Twitter Bootstrap: A very popular way to design clean looking websites.

- lessc: Less is a very popular compiler that makes CSS easier to use by
  extending its syntax. Less is used by Twitter Bootstrap.

- coffeescript: Similar to Less, this is a compiler that gives javascript a
  more eloquent syntax that's easy to learn and requires far less typing.

- south: The standard for managing database schema changes and migrations.
  It's one of the best third party libraries available for Django and is so
  easy to use that I can't possibly imagine why you *wouldn't* want to use it.

- reversion: Allows you to enable version control on your models in the Django
  Admin.  The generated Article model (commented-out) serves as an example of
  how to use this.

- django-debug-toolbar: A very popular tool for debugging everything.  This
  will magically appear when in development mode.

- sphinx: Generates the prettiest documentation.  Inline autodoc style is used
  by the generated code.

- pip/virtualenv: The smartest way to install unstable Python software.

- jquery: Who doesn't use jquery?

- modernizr: Helps you use hip HTML5 features with cross browser support.

Django 1.4 is used with the following cool features configured:

- Time zone awareness
- The secure password hashing extension I wrote!
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection
- Browser-side session data storage (signed cookies)
- Internationalization (localization must be used explicitly)
- Static file framework
- Logging / error reporting system
- Memcached and cached template loading

Here's the files django-bone generates for you:

- ``README.rst``: A simple README file using RestructuredText markup.

- ``doc/index.rst``: Your main sphinx documentation page.

- ``setup.py``: All Python projects should have this!  Even if you don't want
  to put your program on the cheese shop.

- ``scripts/myapp``: Command that gets installed to your bin/ folder.  This
  replaces ``./manage.py --settings=myapp.settings``.

- ``scripts/myapp-dev``: Command that gets installed to your bin/ folder.
  This replaces ``./manage.py --settings=myapp.settings_dev``.

- ``.gitignore``: Preloaded with a list I've built over the years.

- ``conf/init.d/myapp``: This is a script for linux systems to automate
  starting/stopping the gunicorn backend webserver.

- ``conf/nginx/myapp.com.conf``: Shows you how to configure nginx to reverse
  proxy to your gunicorn server.

- ``myapp/urls.py``: A simple URL dispatcher.

- ``myapp/views.py``: Provides an index page view to get you started.

- ``myapp/models.py``: A placeholder for your database tables.

- ``myapp/middleware.py``: Some middleware classes that fix stuff.

- ``myapp/settings.py``: All my favorite production defaults!

- ``myapp/settings_dev.py``: DEBUG mode settings.  This overloads
  ``settings.py``.

- ``myapp/settings_local.py``: Overload settings ONLY for this install.

- ``myapp/tests.py``: Provides a few simple regression tests to make it easy
  for you to get you started with automated testing.  Only amateur software
  engineers forget to write tests so I figured you might want these.

- ``myapp/admin.py``: Gets you started customizing Django admin gui.

- ``myapp/management/commands/minify.py``: A happy js/css/png minify command.

- ``myapp/templates/myapp/base.html``: Master HTML5 template based on
  html5boilerplate.com

- ``myapp/templates/myapp/index.html``: Home page (overrides base.html)

- ``myapp/media/myapp/css/myapp.css``: Main CSS file based off normalize.css
  and html5boilerplate.com

- ``myapp/media/myapp/js/myapp.js``: Placeholder for your javascript code.

- ``myapp/templates/404.html``: Page not found page.

- ``myapp/templates/500.html``: Internal server error page.
