About
=====

django-bone = django + bootstrap + less + coffeescript + sphinx + south +
reversion + jquery + js/css minimization + debug-toolbar + gravatar +
pyflakes + pep8 + git + virtualenv + pip + deployment + tests

Starting a serious Django project? Not a newbie? Good. django-bone will save
you a few days worth of work by generating all the annoying boilerplate code
for you. One simple command is all you need to create a skeleton website with
all the infrastructure you'll need as your project grows.

Here's a screenshot of what you get:

Usage
=====

Here's how you use django-bone, assuming python/pip/virtualenv are installed::

    sudo ./install.sh
    cd /opt
    django-bone myapp

Once that's done, view the README file it generates for more details.

To customize things a bit more, you can do the following::

    AUTHOR="Justine Tunney" \
    EMAIL="jtunney@lobstertech.com" \
    DESCRIP="My Awesome Project" \
    LICENSE="MIT" \
    django-bone myapp

The following tools and libraries will also be configured:

- Twitter Bootstrap: The hippest way to make clean looking websites.

- lessc: Less is a very popular compiler that makes CSS easier to use by
  extending its syntax. Less is used by Twitter Bootstrap.

- coffeescript: Similar to Less, this is a compiler that gives javascript a
  more eloquent syntax that's easy to learn and requires far less typing.

- south: The standard for managing database schema changes and migrations.
  It's one of the best third party libraries available for Django and is so
  easy to use that I can't possibly imagine why you *wouldn't* want to use it.

- reversion: Allows you to enable version control on your models in the Django
  Admin.  The generated Article model (commented-out) serves as an example of
  how to use this.

- django-debug-toolbar: A very popular tool for debugging everything.  This
  will magically appear when in development mode.

- sphinx: Generates the prettiest documentation.  Inline autodoc style is used
  by the generated code.

- pip/virtualenv: The smartest way to install unstable Python software.

- jquery: Who doesn't use jquery?

A shell script for deployment is also created for you. We don't use Fabric
because Fabric is a joke. Shell scripts have stood the test of time, work
better, require fewer lines of code, are easier to write, and understood by
everyone.

Django 1.4 is used with the following cool features configured:

- Time zone awareness
- The secure password hashing extension I wrote!
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection
- Browser-side session data storage (signed cookies)
- Internationalization (localization must be used explicitly)
- Static file framework
- Logging / error reporting system
- Memcached and cached template loading

Here's the files django-bone generates for you:

- ``README.rst``: A simple README file using RestructuredText markup.

- ``doc/index.rst``: Your main sphinx documentation page.

- ``setup.py``: All Python projects should have this!  Even if you don't want
  to put your program on the cheese shop.

- ``scripts/myapp``: Command that gets installed to your bin/ folder.  This
  replaces ``./manage.py --settings=myapp.settings``.

- ``scripts/myapp-dev``: Command that gets installed to your bin/ folder.
  This replaces ``./manage.py --settings=myapp.settings_dev``.

- ``.gitignore``: Preloaded with a list I've built over the years.

- ``conf/init.d/myapp``: This is a script for linux systems to automate
  starting/stopping the gunicorn backend webserver.

- ``conf/nginx/myapp.com.conf``: Shows you how to configure nginx to reverse
  proxy to your gunicorn server.

- ``myapp/urls.py``: A simple URL dispatcher.

- ``myapp/views.py``: Provides an index page view to get you started.

- ``myapp/models.py``: A placeholder for your database tables.

- ``myapp/middleware.py``: Some middleware classes that fix stuff.

- ``myapp/settings.py``: All my favorite production defaults!

- ``myapp/settings_dev.py``: DEBUG mode settings.  This overloads
  ``settings.py``.

- ``myapp/settings_local.py``: Overload settings ONLY for this install.

- ``myapp/tests.py``: Provides a few simple regression tests to make it easy
  for you to get you started with automated testing.  Only amateur software
  engineers forget to write tests so I figured you might want these.

- ``myapp/admin.py``: Gets you started customizing Django admin gui.

- ``myapp/management/commands/minify.py``: A happy js/css/png minify command.

- ``myapp/templates/myapp/base.html``: Master HTML5 template based on
  html5boilerplate.com

- ``myapp/templates/myapp/index.html``: Home page (overrides base.html)

- ``myapp/media/myapp/css/myapp.css``: Main CSS file based off normalize.css
  and html5boilerplate.com

- ``myapp/media/myapp/js/myapp.js``: Placeholder for your javascript code.

- ``myapp/templates/404.html``: Page not found page.

- ``myapp/templates/500.html``: Internal server error page.
