About
=====

Starting a new Django project?  django-bone will save you a day's worth of
work by generating all the annoying boilerplate code for you.  One simple
command is all that's needed to set up everything you'd expect from a
bona-fide python project: a setup file, documentation, unit tests, version
control, virtualenv, db migrations, snazzy html5 boilerplate, js/css
minimization, deployment scripts, init.d file, etc.

django-bone tries to follow popular coding conventions as much as possible.
The primary exception is that I've removed the ``manage.py`` hack because it's
always made me sad that so few Django developers take the time to write
``setup.py`` files like the rest of the python community :(


Usage
=====

Installation::

    sudo cp -a django-bone /usr/local/bin
    sudo chmod go+rwt /opt  # let people create *NEW* files in /opt

Create a new project::

    cd /opt
    django-bone myapp
    cd myapp/myapp
    source ../bin/activate
    myapp-dev runserver

Your project will be configured to use the following tools/libraries:

- south: The standard for managing database schema changes and migrations.
  It's one of the best third party libraries available for Django and is so
  easy to use that I can't possibly imagine why you *wouldn't* want to use it.

- reversion: Allows you to enable version control on your models in the Django
  Admin.  The generated Article model (commented-out) serves as an example of
  how to use this.

- django-debug-toolbar: A very popular tool for debugging everything.  This
  will magically appear when in development mode.

- sphinx: Generates the prettiest documentation.

- pip/virtualenv: The smartest way to install unstable Python software.

- jquery: Who doesn't use jquery?

- modernizr: Helps you use hip HTML5 features with cross browser support.

Here's the files django-bone generates for you:

- ``README.rst``: A simple README file using RestructuredText markup.

- ``doc/index.rst``: Your main sphinx documentation page.

- ``setup.py``: All Python projects should have this!  Even if you don't want
  to put your program on the cheese shop.

- ``scripts/myapp``: Command that gets installed to your bin/ folder.  This
  replaces ``./manage.py --settings=myapp.settings``.

- ``scripts/myapp-dev``: Command that gets installed to your bin/ folder.
  This replaces ``./manage.py --settings=myapp.settings_dev``.

- ``.gitignore``: Preloaded with a list I've built over the years.

- ``conf/init.d/myapp``: This is a script for linux systems to automate
  starting/stopping the gunicorn backend webserver.

- ``conf/nginx/myapp.com.conf``: Shows you how to configure nginx to reverse
  proxy to your gunicorn server.

- ``myapp/urls.py``: A simple URL dispatcher.

- ``myapp/views.py``: Provides an index page view to get you started.

- ``myapp/models.py``: A placeholder for your database tables.

- ``myapp/middleware.py``: Some middleware classes that fix stuff.

- ``myapp/settings.py``: All my favorite production defaults!

- ``myapp/settings_dev.py``: DEBUG mode settings.  This overloads
  ``settings.py``.

- ``myapp/settings_local.py``: Overload settings ONLY for this install.

- ``myapp/tests.py``: Provides a few simple regression tests to make it easy
  for you to get you started with automated testing.  Only amateur software
  engineers forget to write tests so I figured you might want these.

- ``myapp/admin.py``: Gets you started customizing Django admin gui.

- ``myapp/management/commands/minify.py``: A happy js/css/png minify command.

- ``myapp/templates/myapp/base.html``: Master HTML5 template based on
  html5boilerplate.com

- ``myapp/templates/myapp/index.html``: Home page (overrides base.html)

- ``myapp/media/myapp/css/myapp.css``: Main CSS file based off normalize.css
  and html5boilerplate.com

- ``myapp/media/myapp/js/myapp.js``: Placeholder for your javascript code.

- ``myapp/templates/404.html``: Page not found page.

- ``myapp/templates/500.html``: Internal server error page.
